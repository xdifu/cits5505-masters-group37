# Selective Sharing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The selective sharing feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to share their sentiment analysis results with specific other users, rather than just making them publicly available to everyone.

## Key Features
1. **Selective Sharing**: Users can share their results with specific users, ensuring privacy and control.
2. **Multiple Sharing Options**:
   - Quick share with a specific user via username
   - Manage multiple recipients through a multi-select interface
3. **Permissions Management**: Users can add or remove access to their results at any time.
4. **Shared Results View**: Users can see all results shared with them by other users.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Leveraged the existing many-to-many relationship via the `result_shares` association table.
- Maintained the legacy `shared` field for backward compatibility.
- Implemented proper relationship definitions to avoid circular references.

### Forms Implementation
- Created `ShareForm` for sharing with a specific user by username.
- Implemented `ManageSharingForm` for managing multiple sharing recipients.

### Routes Implementation
- `/results/<int:result_id>/share`: Route for sharing with a specific user.
- `/shared_with_me`: Route for viewing results shared with the current user.
- `/result/<int:result_id>/manage_sharing`: Route for managing multiple sharing recipients.

### Templates
- `share_analysis.html`: Form for sharing with a specific user.
- `shared_with_me.html`: Displays results shared with the current user.
- `manage_sharing.html`: Interface for managing multiple sharing recipients.

## Testing
The implementation has been thoroughly tested for:
1. Basic sharing functionality
2. Selective sharing between multiple users
3. Permission removal
4. Routes implementation and template existence

## Future Improvements
- Add notification system for when results are shared with a user
- Enhance the UI for managing sharing permissions
- Add the ability to share with groups of users
- Implement sharing expiration dates

## Conclusion
The selective sharing feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users full control over who can see their sentiment analysis results while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing codebase.
